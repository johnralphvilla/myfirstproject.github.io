            <h2 id="academics">Academics</h2>
            <p>The academic experience in a theology college is designed to deepen students’ understanding of faith,
                scripture, history, and the role of religion in society. Students are encouraged to explore spiritual
                traditions, develop strong critical thinking skills, and engage in meaningful discussions that connect
                theological learning to real-life application.
                Faculty mentors provide guidance and support, while hands-on opportunities like community outreach,
                ministry practice, and group projects help students apply what they learn.
                The goal is to not only gain knowledge,
                but also grow personally and professionally in a supportive learning environment.</p>
